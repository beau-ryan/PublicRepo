    - **Backups & Drafts**: Dedicated folders for drafts, workings, and backup files to ensure project integrity and recovery.

## Development Journey & Philosophy

    This repository reflects my approach as a solo developer:
    - Professional organization and documentation
    - Iterative development with regular backups and drafts
    - Focus on automation, cross-platform compatibility, and technical depth
    - Clear separation of demo/public scripts from advanced/private tools (advanced/private projects are not included here)
    - Emphasis on learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement

### My Journey

    Over the past months, I have built and refined Universal_RunnerApp and supporting scripts, focusing on:
    - Building a modular, scalable backend for network and system management
    - Integrating encryption and security best practices
    - Creating sysadmin tools for diagnostics, monitoring, and automation
    - Documenting every step for maintainability and future growth

## Usage

    - Use demo scripts for learning, testing, or as templates for your own automation.
    - Universal_RunnerApp is designed for flexible deployment, from local testing to production environments.
    - Refer to documentation for project structure, setup, and technical details.
    - Advanced/private scripts and sensitive options are kept out of this public repository for security and ongoing development.

## Future Plans

    - Continue developing Universal_RunnerApp and sysadmin tools
    - Expand demo builds for Linux, Windows, and cross-platform automation
    - Share more technical documentation and guides as projects evolve
    - Add more features for diagnostics, monitoring, and security (excluding advanced/private modules)

## About

    All work in this repository is the result of solo development, reflecting my growth, experimentation, and commitment to professional programming practices. Universal_RunnerApp is the centerpiece, demonstrating my skills in Python, automation, system administration, and secure coding.
