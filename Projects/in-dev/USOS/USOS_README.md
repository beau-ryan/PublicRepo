### Agent Integration Architecture

```plaintext

- How to create a better database or create a better cloud service?
As Amazon and the others are faulty and now using our taxable income to create over usage in our electric bills.

```- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for DecoderX and AgentDecoderX for maintainability
- **Inter-Module Communication**: Secure API endpoints for interaction between AI layers

- Yet I don't want to use AWS, Google, or Amazon as they are all purposely hackable and faulty.
- And I have three computers in my home network to use as servers.
- **Unified Audit Logging**: Centralized logging for all my project and AI actions and decisions

still in Development but soon to be added.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extendable to add new AI capabilities and agents
```
